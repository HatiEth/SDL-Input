This is supposed as a wrapper around SDL2's input api.

Development status: Getting interface done (Do use for prod code with caution - overhauls happen)

Goals of the library:
* Easy integration
* Clear, self-explaining interface
* Multiplayer input handling in mind
* Extensible interfaces


Compiler support:
* Clang
* gcc (untested)
* MinGW-w64 (untested)

See samples/ for intended usage.


If you find anything lacking tickets and contribution are welcome.

Multiple library support may be added if concepts are not broken by doing so.

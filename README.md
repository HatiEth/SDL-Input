This is supposed as a wrapper around SDL2's input api.

Development status: alpha (Do use for prod code with caution)

Goals of the library:
* Easy integration
* Clear, self-explaining interface
* Multiplayer input handling in mind
* Extensible interfaces

Future library support may be added if concepts are not broken by it.
